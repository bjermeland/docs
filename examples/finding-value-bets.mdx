# Find Profitable Bets Instantly with the Value Bets API

If you're serious about sports betting, you know how powerful real-time data can be. Whether you're a developer, sports trader, or running a betting platform, fast and reliable odds comparison can give you a major advantage.

With our **Value Bets API**, you get access to real-time odds from over 250 bookmakers, including industry leaders like **Bet365** and **Pinnacle**. This guide will walk you through how to use our API to uncover profitable bets.

## What Is a Value Bet?

A **value bet** is when a sportsbook offers odds that are too high based on the actual probability of the outcome. These bets have **positive expected value (EV)**, which means they offer long-term profitability when used correctly.

Spotting these bets manually is difficult and time-consuming. Our Value Bets API does the work for you by analyzing live odds and identifying high-EV bets instantly.

## How the Value Bets API Works

Our system scans live odds across more than **250 trusted bookmakers** worldwide. It calculates the expected value for each bet and filters out anything that doesn't offer a clear statistical edge.

You'll only receive bets that have strong upside potential based on the latest odds data.

## Real-Time API Example

With a simple API call, you can retrieve profitable value bets from any bookmaker. For example, to get value bets from Bet365:

```bash
https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&bookmaker=Bet365&includeEventDetails=true
```

This will return live value bets from Bet365, complete with event info, odds, market type, and EV percentage.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl "https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&bookmaker=Bet365&includeEventDetails=true"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const apiKey = process.env.ODDS_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets?apiKey=${apiKey}&bookmaker=Bet365&includeEventDetails=true`
);

const valueBets = await response.json();
console.log(valueBets);
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

api_key = os.environ['ODDS_API_KEY']

response = requests.get(
    'https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets',
    params={
        'apiKey': api_key,
        'bookmaker': 'Bet365',
        'includeEventDetails': True
    }
)

value_bets = response.json()
print(value_bets)
```

```php PHP
<?php
$apiKey = getenv('ODDS_API_KEY');

$url = 'https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets?' . http_build_query([
    'apiKey' => $apiKey,
    'bookmaker' => 'Bet365',
    'includeEventDetails' => true
]);

$response = file_get_contents($url);
$valueBets = json_decode($response, true);
print_r($valueBets);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example Response

Let's say the API returns a bet on the away team, **Manisa Futbol Kulubu**, with an expected value of **110.73%**. That means this bet is priced better than it should be, giving you a statistical edge.

```json
{
  "id": "63628875-Spread-away-Bet365--1",
  "expectedValue": 110.73,
  "expectedValueUpdatedAt": "2025-09-16T11:33:06.615Z",
  "betSide": "away",
  "market": {
    "name": "Spread",
    "hdp": -1,
    "home": "2.491",
    "away": "1.671",
    "max": 150
  },
  "bookmaker": "Bet365",
  "bookmakerOdds": {
    "home": "1.950",
    "away": "1.850",
    "hdp": "-1",
    "href": "https://www.bet365.com/#/AC/B1/C1/D8/E181348466/F3/"
  },
  "eventId": 63628875,
  "event": {
    "home": "Kirikkale FK",
    "away": "Manisa Futbol Kulubu",
    "date": "2025-09-16T12:30:00Z",
    "sport": "Football",
    "league": "Turkiye - Turkiye Kupasi"
  }
}
```

## Understanding the Response

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `expectedValue` | The calculated EV as a percentage | 110.73% means the bet offers 110.73% value |
| `betSide` | Which outcome has value | "away", "home", "over", "under" |
| `market.name` | The betting market | "Spread", "ML", "Over/Under" |
| `bookmakerOdds` | Current odds at the bookmaker | Bet365 offers 1.850 for away |
| `event` | Match details | Teams, date, sport, league |

<Note>
  An expected value of **110.73%** means if you repeatedly place similar bets, you can expect a return of 110.73% over the long run—a significant edge!
</Note>

## Filtering High-Value Bets

Here's how to filter and sort value bets to find the most profitable opportunities:

```javascript
// Filter bets with at least 5% expected value
const highValueBets = valueBets
  .filter(bet => bet.expectedValue >= 5)
  .sort((a, b) => b.expectedValue - a.expectedValue);

// Display the top 5 value bets
highValueBets.slice(0, 5).forEach((bet, index) => {
  console.log(`\n#${index + 1} Value Bet:`);
  console.log(`Match: ${bet.event.home} vs ${bet.event.away}`);
  console.log(`League: ${bet.event.league}`);
  console.log(`Market: ${bet.market.name}`);
  console.log(`Bet on: ${bet.betSide}`);
  console.log(`Odds: ${bet.bookmakerOdds[bet.betSide]}`);
  console.log(`Expected Value: ${bet.expectedValue.toFixed(2)}%`);
  console.log(`Bookmaker: ${bet.bookmaker}`);
  console.log(`Place bet: ${bet.bookmakerOdds.href}`);
});
```

**Output:**
```
#1 Value Bet:
Match: Kirikkale FK vs Manisa Futbol Kulubu
League: Turkiye - Turkiye Kupasi
Market: Spread
Bet on: away
Odds: 1.850
Expected Value: 110.73%
Bookmaker: Bet365
Place bet: https://www.bet365.com/#/AC/B1/C1/D8/E181348466/F3/
```

## Monitoring Multiple Bookmakers

To maximize opportunities, monitor value bets across multiple bookmakers:

```javascript
const bookmakers = ['Bet365', 'Pinnacle', 'Unibet', 'William Hill', 'DraftKings'];

async function getAllValueBets() {
  const apiKey = process.env.ODDS_API_KEY;

  const promises = bookmakers.map(bookmaker =>
    fetch(
      `https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets?apiKey=${apiKey}&bookmaker=${bookmaker}&includeEventDetails=true`
    ).then(res => res.json())
  );

  const results = await Promise.all(promises);

  // Combine all value bets
  const allBets = results.flat();

  // Filter for minimum 5% EV and sort by EV
  const topBets = allBets
    .filter(bet => bet.expectedValue >= 5)
    .sort((a, b) => b.expectedValue - a.expectedValue);

  return topBets;
}

const valueBets = await getAllValueBets();
console.log(`Found ${valueBets.length} value bets across all bookmakers`);
```

## Real-World Use Case: Automated Alerts

Build an automated system that alerts you when high-value bets appear:

```javascript
class ValueBetMonitor {
  constructor(apiKey, minEV = 5) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.minEV = minEV;
    this.bookmakers = ['Bet365', 'Pinnacle', 'Unibet'];
    this.notifiedBets = new Set();
  }

  async checkForValueBets() {
    for (const bookmaker of this.bookmakers) {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://api2.odds-api.io/v3/value-bets?apiKey=${this.apiKey}&bookmaker=${bookmaker}&includeEventDetails=true`
        );

        const bets = await response.json();

        bets
          .filter(bet => bet.expectedValue >= this.minEV)
          .filter(bet => !this.notifiedBets.has(bet.id))
          .forEach(bet => {
            this.sendAlert(bet);
            this.notifiedBets.add(bet.id);
          });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error checking ${bookmaker}:`, error);
      }
    }
  }

  sendAlert(bet) {
    const message = `
🎯 Value Bet Alert!

${bet.event.home} vs ${bet.event.away}
${bet.event.league} | ${bet.event.sport}

Market: ${bet.market.name}
Bet on: ${bet.betSide.toUpperCase()}
Odds: ${bet.bookmakerOdds[bet.betSide]}
Expected Value: ${bet.expectedValue.toFixed(2)}%

Bookmaker: ${bet.bookmaker}
Place bet: ${bet.bookmakerOdds.href}
    `.trim();

    console.log(message);
    // Send via email, SMS, Telegram, etc.
  }

  start(intervalSeconds = 30) {
    console.log('Starting value bet monitor...');
    this.checkForValueBets(); // Initial check
    setInterval(() => this.checkForValueBets(), intervalSeconds * 1000);
  }
}

// Usage
const monitor = new ValueBetMonitor(process.env.ODDS_API_KEY, 5);
monitor.start(30); // Check every 30 seconds
```
